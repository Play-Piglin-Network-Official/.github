Today marks the day where we have started backing up all of Play Piglin Network and start closing the server. For the time being the minigames will be closing one by one and the server will soon close. But its not over for Play Piglin Network, since im backing up all the files, I have plans to reopen the server at a later date when I have the time and money to be able to run a home server.

That being said the websites and minecraft servers will soon go offline and will re open at a later date, but the discord server will stay open for everyone to chat in.

As for the discord server, We have no plans to shutdown the sever but we may reform the server to keep make it more of a chatting sever rather than just focused on minecraft.

Notable changes have been made to the discord server as we are keeping this open for chatting with one another. All our bots will remain online.

Change Log: Minecraft server is now offline. All website will go down once we have all files and db info. The domains will not be parked or up for sale as im keeping them. Discord server has been converted to a chatting community not just a minecraft based server.

We would like to thank each and everyone of you and we cant wait to see you in the discord server or in the future when we re open Play Piglin Network.
